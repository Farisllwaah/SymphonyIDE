Changed A(Type/Expression)SingleDefinition.identifiers -> [identifier]:LexIdentifierToken

Renamed AChannelNameDefinition -> AChannelDefinition

Renamed AChannelsDefinition.channelNameDeclarations: AChannelNameDefinition -> Renamed AChannelsDefinition.channelDeclarations: AChannelDefinition

Changed AOperations.operations: SCmlOperationDefinition* -> AOperations.operations: SOperationDefinition*

Changed AStateDefinition.(invdef/initdef): AExplicitFunctionDefinition -> Changed AStateDefinition.(invdef/initdef): SFunctionDefinition

Added: AActionClassDefinition used for the inner part of an ActionDefinition

Removed SCmlOperations complete tree. Replaced by SOperations note that the AImplicitOperation.result is not a list in the replaced version.

Removed all types but AProcessType

Changed AActionProcess.definitionParagraphs to AActionProcess.actionDefinition : AActionClassDefinition

Removed ADeclarationInstanciatedAction Dead node

Changed type of PParametrisation.declaration changed to ALocalDefinition

Removed SStatementAction complete subtree deleted

Added AUnresolvedStateDesignator which will be rewritten by TC to the apropiate PStateDesignator

Added AUnresolvedObjectDesignator which will be rewritten by TC to the apropiate PObjectDesignator

Added statements to the statement tree PStm
	AActionStm wrapper to hold an action in a statement context
	ANewStm
	SNonDeterministic is moved here from PAction
	
Added actions to the action tree PAction
	AStm wrapper to hold a statement in a statement in an action context
	ACallAction holds an action call
	
	
Added ACallObjectStm for a.b() when used as a statement. Otherwise an AApply expression is used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rewrites:
	Rewrites ACallStm to ACallAction if the call name is an action
	Rewrites ASkipAction to ASkipStm if the skip is in a statement context
	Rewrites attempt to remove all ABracketType when possible
	Rewrites AInitialDefinition to just become the inner operation
	Rewrites Access on ATypeDefinition and SFunctionDefinition to Public and for the latter also static
	Rewrites AActionStm and AStmAction such that they dont do double wrapping
	Rewrites ASequentialCompositionAction to a ABlockSimpleBlockStm when is it used inside operations
	Rewrites ILexNameToken to contain the module they refer to or are decleared within
	Rewrites AUnresolvedPathExp to the correct AVariableExp
	Rewrites AUnresolvedStateDesignator to a valid PStateDesignator
	Rewrites AUnresolvedObjectDesignator to a valid PObjectDesignator
	Rewrites ANewStm to a ANewExp wrapped in an AAssignmantStm
