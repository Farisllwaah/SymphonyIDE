// This example show a process that chooses values from a channel that accepts natural 
//numbers and uses them. There are infinite values to be communicated. However there are specific
//values that cause a deadlock and the model checker is able to find them. To achieve this, it is 
//necessary that at least two instances are internally created (chosen) by the model checker.
//This must be set in the Model Checker preferences.
//furthermore, this example shows a system that cannot be analysed by tools like FDR and PAT due to 
//manipulation of infinite events.
