        <h1>The COMPASS Tool</h1>
        <p>
        The COMPASS tool aims to support the building of models of System of Systems (SoSs) using the COMPASS Modelling Language (CML) notation and provide analysis of global properties on these modeles.

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> The user manuals for the different features are included as pdf files in the distribution.</li>
            <li> Public CML examples can be imported using the File -> Import -> COMPASS -> COMPASS examples selection. </li>
        </ul>
        <p> 
        <h2>Upgrading Workspaces</h2>
        </p>
            <p>
            Due to current development pace, new versions of COMPASS may 
            not be compatible with workspaces from previous versions. This often
            materializes in "Editor could not be initialized" errors. Creating
            new workspaces usually solves these problems. In order to do so:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Delete the existing workspace folder from file system (be
                sure to backup any projects you wish to preserve).</li>
                <li>Start the COMPASS tool adn point the workspace to a 
                new location or recreate the old one.</li>
                <li>Recreate any projects you wish to work on. Afterwards use
                Import... -> File System to import the relevant CML sources into 
                your new projects.
            </ol> 
        
        <p>
            <h2>Submitting bugs</h2>
	    </p>
        The COMPASS tool is in constant development. You
        can help improve it by submitting bugs or requesting new features
	    </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The COMPASS bug tracker is available <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/compassresearch/tickets/">here</a>.</li>
                <li>You can also request features requests <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/compassresearch/tickets/"> here</a>.</li>
            	<li>Please note that a Sourceforge account is necessary to submit feature requests.</li>
            	<li>You can report bugs anonymously but please sign the ticket so we can get in touch with you.</li>
