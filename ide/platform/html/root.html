        <h1>The COMPASS Tool</h1>
        <p>
        The COMPASS tool aims to support the building of models of SoSs  and
        the analysis of global properties on these modeles.

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> The user manual (D31_2a) can be found in the SVN repository in Theme3/WP31.</li>
            <li> CML examples can also be found in the project repository under Common/CaseStudies. </li>
        </ul>
        <p> 
        <h2>Upgrading Workspaces</h2>
        </p>
            <p>
            Due to current development pace, new versions of COMPASS may 
            not be compatible with workspaces from previous versions. This often
            materializes in "Editor could not be initialized" errors. Creating
            new workspaces usually solves these problems. In order to do so:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Delete the existing workspace folder from file system (be
                sure to backup any projects you wish to preserve).</li>
                <li>Start the COMPASS tool adn point the workspace to a 
                new location or recreate the old one.</li>
                <li>Recreate any projects you wish to work on. Afterwards use
                Import... -> File System to import the relevant CML sources into 
                your new projects.
            </ol> 
        
        <p>
            <h2>Submitting bugs</h2>
