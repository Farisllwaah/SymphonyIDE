-------------Log-------------

-------------questions-------------

- Is channels and chanset global to the entire model?

- what is the default qualifier if left out?

- there need to be a realLiteral as well 

- Why not put "asignment call" in assignment rule???

-------------modifications-------------

- the implicit function grammar does not match with the example( I corrected the example)
	-Missing ';' between the functions

- The grammar for chanset and channels does not specify the 'chansets' and 'channels' top word. I added them.

- The "'actions'" keyword is missing before "process paragraph" in "process" grammar definition at page 23. I added this.

- call statement on page 41 causes shift reduce errors. object designator vs. state designator is not going to work nicely together.

- shift/reduce for channeldefinitions
	Changes:
	- changed "declaration" to "single type declaration" on  page 27

action rule:
	- the action rule should have IDENTIFIER as alternative. This is in the fixing process now!
	- '(', action , ')' is already in blockstatement rule and is removed

-------------Errors/Missing in latex grammar-------------

- missing "," concat symbol on line 795 col 68 in latex file
	- Actually, I can find all the missing concat symbols in the latex grammar. Would that be of any help?
